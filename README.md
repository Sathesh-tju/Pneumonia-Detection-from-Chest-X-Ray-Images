# Pneumonia-Detection-from-Chest-X-Ray-Images
Pneumonia Detection using deep learning (ResNet50 transfer learning). Includes preprocessing, training and evaluation scripts, confusion matrix, and false-positive/false-negative analysis on chest X-ray images. Notebook-based workflow with reproducible experiments and performance metrics.

The objective of Task 1 is to construct a CNN-based binary classifier to detect pneumonia or normality in the chest X-ray images (PneumoniaMNIST). The PneumoniaMNIST contains very low resolution (28*28 pixels) images. Therefore, the small pathological patterns can be collapsed into a few pixels due to their spatial diffusion and fine grain. Feature engineering is the key role in deep learning model architecture. The baseline CNN kernels struggle to extract the prominent features from the edges and lung boundaries (high-frequency details). The low contrast and intensity variability provide uneven illumination and exposure of the medical images, which makes it very challenging to extract the features. In addition, the pneumonia patterns are too weak to produce sharply localized lesions. Therefore, this subtle and diffuse pneumonia pattern identification and feature extraction are very challenging.

The PneumoniaMNIST often exhibits a class imbalance and becomes biased toward the majority class. Also, the dataset contains high intra-class variability; therefore, the extracted feature has high variance even for the same label. Predicting pneumonia is quite complex because of the increasing intricacy of the data. Therefore, the identification of weak edges and texture discriminability is due to texture changes, which consist of low geometric shapes. To address these issues, I prefer to use advanced ResNet-50 because the pneumonia patterns can be subtle and the dataset is limited to train a deep learning model from scratch. The ResNet-50 consists of residual network architecture, which is able to capture the distributed pneumonia pattern from the feature map. The proposed ResNet-50 model can learn edge, significant texture, and spatial feature hierarchies well. In addition, it contains deeper networks to capture complex texture variations and can detect spatially distributed opacity patterns, which is challenging with baseline models. Moreover, the ResNet-50’s residual design acts as an implicit regularizer, helping to identify the feature without overfitting.

In the given dataset, the two classes (normal, pneumonia) are fixed for binary classification. The original PneumoniaMNIST resolution is resized to 224*224 for ResNet-50. The 3-channel is set for the pretrained ImageNet backbone. The batch size is 32, and the learning rate is set to 1.e-4 and 1. e-5 initial set for the initial training phase and fine-tuning phase, respectively. I divided it into two phases that train the top layers for the feature extraction stage under the first phase and the fine-tuning phase with hyperparameter tuning under the second stage.

The classifier head is trained while the ResNet-50 backbone remains completely frozen. By freezing the backbone, the proposed model avoids altering these filters before the new classification layers to the pneumonia dataset. In this stage, the dense head learns to map the extracted feature embedding to the binary decision space (normal and pneumonia). The entire network was trained immediately from the beginning with random head initialization and large gradients from the untrained dense layer that can propagate the pretrained convolutional filters. Because the phase 1 acts as a controlled adaptation step that aligns the new classification boundary with feature representation. The significance of phase 2 provides the fine-tuning, and it is performed by unfreezing a deeper layer of the backbone while keeping the earlier layer frozen. The second phase of training is not a redundant procedure. Also, it helps to reduce the overfitting risk and stabilize the gradient flow that enables the controlled domain adaptation of pretrained convolutional features.

I have computed the evaluation stack F1-score, confusion matrix plot, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) plot, accuracy, precision, recall, and loss for binary cross entropy. The visualization I have included here is visible in the program. I have analyzed 12 cases for false negative and false positive conditions to verify the failure cases. In addition, the random test was conducted for the samples. 
The proposed ResNet-50 backbone pretrained on ImageNet provides prominent feature extraction during learning. The ResNet-50’s intermediate convolutional filters capture useful edge, gradient, and texture information. This phenomenon improves the model's convergence speed and preserves the low-level information through deeper network semantic abstraction. The main strength of my proposed model is high sensitivity (96.67%), because it rarely misses pneumonia (FN rate = 3.33%). Also, I believe it is for a screening-style setting where the priority is to capture most pathological cases. In addition, the two-phase transfer learning strategy is a strong design choice for the medical dataset. Also, it reduces overfitting risk and stabilizes convergence. The model achieves a reasonable 86.87% and demonstrates overall balance (F1 = 91.5% given for the dataset). The model lacks lower specificity, with 75.65% obtained by 57 false positives (FP). Therefore, the proposal gets FP heavy. Practically, it tends to overcall pneumonia in medical images. This typically happens when normal CXRs consist of these patterns that resemble opacity-like regions, motion blur, exposure variation, and label ambiguity due to threshold dependence. In the future, the probability of threshold dependence will be calibrated instead of fixed at 0.5. The decision-based threshold tuning is also under consideration for future work to reduce the FP while preserving high sensitivity.
